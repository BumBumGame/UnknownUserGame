---XML Format for communicator:
- As Maintag <communicatorChat> will be used to create a new chat structure
- Every Message or Question will have the Tag <communicatorChatMessage>
  - As Types there can currently be used: messagerStatement, question, messagerWarning
- The Content of every message will be defined with a <messageContent> Tag inside of <communicatorChatMessage>
  - In Questions every possible Answer can be defined with a new <Answer> Tag
    - To save a condition if a certain Answer has been chosen, put a setCondition=[ConditionName] Attribute in the Answer Tag
- To check for a condition at any communicatorChatMessage or Answer then just put a checkCondition = [ConditionName] or checkNotCondition = [ConditionName] Attribute in the according Tag

Communicator Branches:
- New Conversation Branches will be created with <branch> Tags at the End of the currently active branch
- Branch tags can have an optional name = [BranchName] Attribute for better description
- <branch> Tags can also check conditions
- If a branch reaches its end it will check the Conditions for the new <branch> tags and will choose the first one of which all conditions are true
- If there are no further <branch> Tags at the end of a branch, The communicator will be ended.
- The main starting Branch is not specified with a branch Tag
- To jump to a branch from an answer: Put a jumpToBranch = [BranchIndex] or jumpToBranchName = [BranchName] Attribute in the Answer tag
  - BranchIndex: Index of the Branch text starting from 0, Example: 1.Branchtag: Index = 0, 2.Branchtag: Index = 1, etc.
  - BranchName: The name of a branch, if written as Attribute into Branch name
  - If Branch to Jump to is not found, it will be ignored and the Reader carries on as normal
